LightCloth enables fullcolor illumination, bi-directional data communication and position sensing on soft surfaces.
An optical fiber typically acts as a waveguide from one end to the other.
Another type of the fiber is "diffusive" optical fiber which leaks some light through microscratches on its surface.
A cloth woven from such diffusive optical fibers has been used in fashion and spatial design fields for making light-emitting fabric products .
A diffusive optical fiber not only leaks light but also receives light incident on its surface.
The light entering from the scratches on the surface goes through the core and leaks out from the ends.
Focusing on this property, we developed a new fabric I/O  device, called "LightCloth," that enables illumination, bi-directional data communication, and position sensing .
We introduce an input and output device that enables illumination, bi-directional data communication, and position sensing on a soft cloth.
This "LightCloth" is woven from diffusive optical fibers.
Sensor-emitter pairs attached to bundles of contiguous fibers enable bundle-specific light input and output.
We developed a prototype system that allows full-color illumination and 8-bit data input by infrared signals.
