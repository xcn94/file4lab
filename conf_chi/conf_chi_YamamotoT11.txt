In this paper, we propse a system for supporting users to judge the credibility of Web search results.
Our proposed system provides users the following three functions:  calculation and visualization of scores for Web search results from main credibility aspects,  prediction of user's credibility model through user's feedback for Web search resuls, and  reranking of Web search results based on user's predicted credibility model.
Conventional Web search engines provide only titles, snippets, and URLs for users, and so there are few clues to judge the credibility of Web search results.
Moreover, ranking algorithms of the conventional Web search engine are often based on relevance and popularity of Web pages.
Few Web search engines use crediblity-based ranking algorithms.
Our proposed system enables users to do credibility-oriented Web search.
