Agents to assist in finding help!
When a person doesn't know what to do, she asks someone else.
In our everyday activities, we take advantage of the community surrounding us.
We ask other people for assistance.
We use their knowledge to help solve our problems.
We leverage information from the existing collective.
In this project we explore the possibilities that arise from building agents  that can determine a person's expertise and find people who can be of assistance in a given situation.
We try to encourage people to exchange information in the community.
Some of our challenges in this project are: user expertise profiles: have the agents - Building read through users files and determine their areas and levels of expertise.
By using a simple domain model, we can also determine what related knowledge each user has.
This may not always be the topmost expert on the field!
We try to create an environment which encourages cooperation and sharing.
We have built a prototype system which deals with the Java programming domain.
Agents read through each user's source code files to determine what they know how to do.
Given a query, the agents try to find a suitable match by analyzing each user's profiles.
Once a match is found, the users can send messages to each other.
The system indicates how helpful each user is to the community, trying to establish a connection between users.
The system keeps track of how helpful each user is to the community and displays that information when appropriate.
The idea is to create social capital, such that the users will contribute to the community hoping the community will give back to them, as opposed to more restricted one-on-one transactions.
