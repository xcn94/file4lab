Collaboration is a core component of work activities amongst flight attendants as they work to promote onboard safety and a high level of customer service.
Yet it can be difficult to maintain efficient communication, situation awareness, and information exchange given the technologies currently available on airplanes.
We present a prototype called "Smart Crew"; a smart watch application that allows flight attendants to maintain an awareness of each other and communicate through messaging with haptic feedback.
It is designed with an emphasis on real time information access and direct communication between flight attendants regardless of their location.
